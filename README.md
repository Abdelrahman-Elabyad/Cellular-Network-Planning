# 📡 Cellular Network Planning Tool

This project provides a complete solution for estimating the **minimum number of cellular base stations** required to cover a specific area while meeting defined **user density** and **traffic demands**. The full implementation is developed using **both MATLAB and Python**, allowing flexibility in simulation, analysis, and prototyping.

## 🚀 Project Description

The tool enables cellular network planners to model and analyze system performance under various configurations and constraints.

### 🔍 Objectives

- Calculate the **minimum number of cells** required for a given area and user density.
- Optimize for:
  - **Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR)**
  - **Erlang per user**
  - **Total bandwidth constraints**
- Select the most efficient **sectoring type** (60°, 120°, or 180°) for coverage and performance.
- Analyze the impact of **Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR)** on overall network capacity and interference.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Dual implementation: logic and simulations are written in both **MATLAB** and **Python**.
- Consistent outputs across both platforms for verification and benchmarking.
- Modular structure: easy to update parameters or extend for 5G/HetNet use cases.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**:
  - Input validation
  - Network dimensioning calculations
  - Basic CLI-based interaction and plotting
- **MATLAB**:
  - Simulation of cell layouts and reuse patterns
  - Graphical visualization of network coverage
  - Frequency planning and interference mapping

## 📈 Outputs

- Number of required cells based on traffic and geographic area
- Optimal sectoring configuration
- Suggested reuse pattern (e.g., reuse-1, reuse-3 with FFR)
- Visual plots (MATLAB) and numerical outputs (Python)

## 📌 Usage

1. Choose either the MATLAB or Python version based on your preferred environment.
2. Update parameters inside the script (e.g., user density, area size, bandwidth).
3. Run the simulation and interpret the results (plots or printed metrics).

## 📚 Notes

- Both implementations are aligned in logic and assumptions to allow comparison.
- MATLAB version offers better visualization; Python version allows faster iterations.
